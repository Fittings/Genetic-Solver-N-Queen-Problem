How To Use
==========
python nqueens_app.py
 - input how many solutions you want to find (non-unique)

nqueens_app will produce an output file that records some data that could be useful for reading. It will also print out the average epoch count (representing the amount of populations that have been repopulated per solution).




n-Queen-Problem
===============
The n Queen problem is to find a solution such that n queens are placed on
a board who are not immediately attacking one another. (As per chess rules).

This program finds a solution to the n queen problem by picking queens that are
almost in a good position, and replacing the badly positioned queens with a
combination of the 'good' queens.
