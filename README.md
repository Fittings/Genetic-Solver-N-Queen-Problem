n-Queen-Problem
===============
The n Queen problem is to find a solution such that n queens are placed on
a board who are not immediately attacking one another. (As per chess rules).

This program finds a solution to the n queen problem by picking queens that are
almost in a good position, and replacing the badly positioned queens with a
combination of the 'good' queens.
