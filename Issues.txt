My current solution is trying to find the optimal position of the individual queen. This becomes a problem when trying to find the optimal position of all the queens. So Im probably going to have to redo a significant portion of my work soon. :(

Because of the way numbers are counted, the greater deviance (percentage wise)
from the length of the y value (eg 20 => 2, 100 => 3), the greater deviance the
y value average is from the true~ y value.
This isn't too big of an issue for anything in ranges such as (0, ~20] or
[100, ~200]. but becomes a huge issue at 30 queen count.
