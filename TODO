1) Need to set-up a way of testing the fitness of the queen. This can be done
   by assessing its collisions.
      1.1) Need a way to assess collisions with other queens!
      1.2) Make a list of queens in desc. order of fitness.

2) Need to have a way of keep our 'best' queens and replacing the 'worst' queens with a cross-over / mutation combo

3) Need to implement a cross-over between parents (uniquely) and also mutate




================

I'm thinking at this point, I should have created a Queen class. The queen class
would be used to store data about each queen (x,y co-ords, y-key, fitness level)
and then ;)
At the moment, every queen is identified by their y-key value, which means I have
to constantly refer to methods that are able to extract more info out of it.
